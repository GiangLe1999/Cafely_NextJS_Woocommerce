Good thing these come in a bundle and I got to save a few bucks. Aroma and taste wise, theyâ€™re fantastic! Amazing aroma, got me perked up and feeling more awake LOL. The taste is 100% awesome! Excellent bold coffee flavors in all three. And what a strong energy boost! Delivered exactly what they promised. I felt more focused and energized the whole day! No coffee crash on this one too or jitters. My personal favorite? Saigon, hands down, is the best in taste and aroma. But when the day calls for stronger coffee, Banme works great!",
